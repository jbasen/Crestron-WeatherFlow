V5.5 - Misc Bug Fixes and enhancements

V5.2 - Bug fix to address an issue with JSON parsing

v5.1 - Bug fixes and reducing the polling interval for observation data to 1 minute to match
the rate at which WeatherFlow updates the observation data.  This change was made based on a
conversation with WeatherFlow. Updated files in the WeatherFlowV2 S#.zip file go along with this
version

5/30/23 - IMPORTANT UPDATE - WeatherFlow just changed things with their security that has caused the 
Crestron-WeatherFlow modules to stop working.  To fix the issue, first you will need to download
the latest version of the modules.  Significant changes have been made to the modules

1) The observations module is the closest to the original WeatherFlow module.  It polls the
WeatherFlow clould api for updates every 15 minutes.  There are both analog and formatted
display string outputs.

2) the Forecast module now includes information to work around the lack of weather forecast data
being supplied by Crestron.  Again, it uses the WeatherFlow cloud service to obtain data

3) UDP module.  This module displays data that is sent directly from the weather station using 
UDP messages on the homeowner's local network.  So, this the information from this module is 
not reliant on the WeatherFlow cloud service and also doesn't require an active Internet connection; 
making it more resilient to supplying weather information during a bad storm.  

There is information in the module help files on obtaining a Personal Access Token and the ID of your
WeatherFlow weather station; both of which are required as parameters by the observation and forecast
modules.

The UDP module only requires the IP address of your WeatherFlow hub.  The hub's IP address should either
be static or have a DHCP reservation so it doesn't change over time.

These new modules have been tested BUT a hardware issue with my station has kept me from fully testing
all aspects of the new UDP module.  So, consider them as beta versions for the moment.  Also, the modules
been coded to work with the Tempest, as well as Sky and Air, WeatherFlow weather stations.  However, I only
have a Tempest station to work with so testing has been limited to the Tempest.

4/13/23 - New files have been uploaded.  V4 adds support for the WeatherFlow UDP messages.  This, for example. 
provides for triggers when rain is detected.

5/6/21 - A new version of WeatherFlowV2 S#.zip has been uploaded that fixes a null exception error.  Please use the
WeatherFlowV2.clz file included in this zip file.

Version 2 adds:
1) Minor bug fixes
2) Pulling additional data elements, such as battery voltage, directly from the station devices
3) Support for WeatherFlow's new Tempest Weather System

The Crestron module pulls observation data from a Weatherflow smart weather station using the Weatherflow Rest API
Data is pulled every 15 minutes.  Outputs from the module include stings (formatted for display) of the data elements,
Analog values of the data elements (some of them scaled by 10 or 100 so accuracy isn't lost), and digital outputs that
indicate which elements were successfully extracted from the weather station and which weren't.  

Please note that an include path statement was added to the S+ module as I have seen compilation issues when the clz
file is simply placed in the Usrsplus directory.  You will need to change this statement to the location where you 
place clz files on your computer.
