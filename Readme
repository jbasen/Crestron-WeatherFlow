The Crestron module pulls observation data from a Weatherflow smart weather station using the Weatherflow Rest API
Data is pulled every 15 minutes.  Outputs from the module include stings (formatted for display) of the data elements,
Analog values of the data elements (some of them scaled by 10 or 100 so accuracy isn't lost), and digital outputs that
indicate which elements were successfully extracted from the weather station and which weren't.  

Version 2 adds:
1) Minor bug fixes
2) Pulling additional data elements, such as battery voltage, directly from the station devices
3) Support for WeatherFlow's new Tempest Weather System

Please note that an include path statement was added to the S+ module as I have seen compilation issues when the clz
file is simply placed in the Usrsplus directory.  You will need to change this statement to the location where you 
place clz files on your computer.

5/6/21 - A new version of WeatherFlowV2 S#.zip has been uploaded that fixes a null exception error.  Please use the
WeatherFlowV2.clz file included in this zip file.
